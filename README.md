# Cross-Modal Retrieval with Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence

This project implements a multi-modal neural network that integrates image, text, and audio features. It supports contrastive learning and reconstruction objectives, designed for cross-modal retrieval tasks.

## Highlights
1. First application of CS divergence to cross-modal retrieval.
2. Stable, hyperparameter-free, and linearly scalable alignment.
3. Generalized CS (GCS) extends to arbitrary modalities using Hölder’s inequality.
4. Plug-and-play: simply replace KL/MMD losses in existing frameworks.
5. Outperforms SOTA on CUHK-PEDS, Wikipedia, NUS-WIDE, PKU-XMediaNet, Flickr30K, KIT-ML.

## 🧠 Model Overview

### 🔹 Modalities

- Image: Visual embeddings are extracted using CLIP ViT-B/32 [CLIP ViT-B/32](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32) 
- Text: Semantic representations are obtained via DistilBERT. [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) 
- Audio: Pre-extracted features (e.g., from Wav2Vec2 or VGGish) are linearly projected into a shared embedding space.[Wav2vec2.0](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/wav2vec#wav2vec-20.)

### 🔹 Fusion Strategy

- Cross-modal attention is used to enable inter-modal interaction.
- The fused representation is supervised by auxiliary tasks such as audio reconstruction to encourage semantic alignment and knowledge sharing across modalities.

## 📂 Data Preparation

This project uses the Flickr30k dataset. You can download it from:

Dataset: Flickr30k [Flickr30k](https://google.github.io/localized-narratives/index.html)

After downloading, organize the files into the following structure:

data/Flickr30k/
├── Flickr30k/
│   ├── images/              # Original image files (.jpg)
│   ├── audio_features/      # Pre-extracted audio features (.npy)
├── flickr30k_train_captions.jsonl
└── flickr30k_test_captions.jsonl


Note: Audio features should be pre-extracted using pretrained models such as Wav2Vec2, saved in .npy format. Filenames must align with image_id and annotator_id.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start training:

```bash
python train.py
```
